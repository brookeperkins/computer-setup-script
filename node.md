### Install Node
* Node provides access to several important global objects for use with Node program files. When writing a file that will run in a Node environment, these variables will be accessible in the global scope of your file.
Node “uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.” In practice, this means that Node is built well to handle asynchronous JavaScript code to perform many asynchronous activities such as reading and writing to the file system, handling connections to database servers, or handling requests as a web server.
